# frame2frame

Frame2Frame is aimed to become an advanced paint tool for kids or artists to develop photorealistic images from sketches and use these as keyframes for the automatic creation of intermediate frames. Movement-flow is aimed to be learned class specific. As this is a more complex task, even smaller steps in the creation can be used as artistic transition tool for videos.
